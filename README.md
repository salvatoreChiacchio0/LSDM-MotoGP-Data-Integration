# MotoGP Data Integration Project

This project was developed as part of the Large Scale Data Management course and covers only the first part, Information Integration. 
The work is focused on the MotoGP domain, where data about races, riders, circuits, bikes, teams, and weather conditions was collected from different sources and integrated into a unified database. 
The goal is to enable insightful queries and analysis on the integrated data. 
More details can be found later in the pdf presentation file.

## Project Structure
- **Data Collection**: Scripts for scraping and converting race dates, weather data, and rider information from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: Python scripts for cleaning, filtering, and transforming raw data into structured formats suitable for integration.
- **Datasets**: CSV and JSON files containing information about races, riders, circuits, bikes, teams, and weather conditions.
